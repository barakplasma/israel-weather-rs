To proceed with your request, please let me know what specific changes or features you would like to implement in your project. Once I understand your requirements, I can identify which files are most likely to need changes.

#### I want to modify the source code so that it stops logging logs to stdout. I only want json on stdout, logs should be on stderr or debug logs or something  

To modify the source code so that logs are not sent to stdout, but instead to stderr or a debug log, we will likely need to make changes to the logging configuration in your Rust project. The files that are most likely to need changes are:

1. `src/lib.rs` - This file contains functions that utilize logging, such as `trace!` and `error!`, and may include the logging configuration setup.

Please add `src/lib.rs` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

> src/lib.rs  
> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

To redirect logs to stderr and ensure that only JSON is output to stdout, we can adjust the logging configuration. We'll use the `tracing` crate's `tracing_subscriber` to configure the logging output. Here's how you can modify `src/lib.rs`:

1. Add `tracing_subscriber` to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml` if it's not already there.
2. Configure the logger to output logs to stderr.

Let's make the necessary changes in `src/lib.rs`:

src/lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
use tracing::{error, instrument, trace, warn};
=======
use tracing::{error, instrument, trace, warn};
use tracing_subscriber::fmt::format::FmtSpan;
use tracing_subscriber::fmt::SubscriberBuilder;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#[instrument]
=======
fn init_logging() {
    SubscriberBuilder::default()
        .with_writer(std::io::stderr)
        .with_span_events(FmtSpan::CLOSE)
        .init();
}

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
fn make_cache(offline: bool) -> PathBuf {
=======
fn make_cache(offline: bool) -> PathBuf {
    init_logging();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that logs are sent to stderr, and the `init_logging` function will be called at the start of the `make_cache` function to initialize the logging configuration. 

If you haven't added `tracing_subscriber` to your `Cargo.toml`, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
cargo add tracing-subscriber
```

After making these changes, you can run your application to verify that logs are now directed to stderr.

> Tokens: 4.6k sent, 361 received. Cost: $0.01 message, $0.04 session.  
> Cargo.toml  
> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

Let's proceed with the changes to ensure logs are directed to stderr and JSON is output to stdout. We'll make the necessary changes in `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs`.

First, ensure `tracing-subscriber` is configured correctly in `Cargo.toml`:

Cargo.toml
```toml
<<<<<<< SEARCH
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = [
=======
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = [
    "fmt",
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update `src/lib.rs` to configure the logger:

src/lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
use tracing::{error, instrument, trace, warn};
=======
use tracing::{error, instrument, trace, warn};
use tracing_subscriber::fmt::format::FmtSpan;
use tracing_subscriber::fmt::SubscriberBuilder;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#[instrument]
=======
fn init_logging() {
    SubscriberBuilder::default()
        .with_writer(std::io::stderr)
        .with_span_events(FmtSpan::CLOSE)
        .json()
        .init();
}

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
fn make_cache(offline: bool) -> PathBuf {
=======
fn make_cache(offline: bool) -> PathBuf {
    init_logging();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that logs are sent to stderr in JSON format, and the `init_logging` function will be called at the start of the `make_cache` function to initialize the logging configuration.

After applying these changes, you can run your application to verify that logs are now directed to stderr in JSON format.

#### What's wrong? Fix  

The error message indicates that the `act` command is not found, which means that the `act` tool is not installed on your system. `act` is a tool that allows you to run GitHub Actions locally. To fix this, you need to install `act`.

Here's how you can install `act` using `podman`:

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/nektos/act:latest
alias act='podman run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/github/workspace -w /github/workspace ghcr.io/nektos/act:latest'
```

This command pulls the latest `act` image from GitHub Container Registry and sets up an alias to run `act` using `podman`. After running these commands, you should be able to use `act` to run your GitHub Actions locally.

The error you're encountering indicates that there might be an issue with accessing the GitHub Container Registry. This could be due to authentication requirements or network restrictions. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Authenticate with GitHub Container Registry**: You might need to authenticate with the GitHub Container Registry to pull images. You can do this by creating a personal access token on GitHub with the appropriate scopes and then logging in with `podman`.

   ```bash
   podman login ghcr.io
   ```

   When prompted, use your GitHub username and the personal access token as the password.

2. **Check Network Restrictions**: Ensure that your network allows access to `ghcr.io`. Sometimes, firewalls or network policies might block access to certain

#### Unable to install global subscriber: SetGlobalDefaultError("a global default trace dispatcher has already been set")  
#### note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace  
#### Error: Process completed with exit code 101.  

The error message indicates that a global default trace dispatcher has already been set, which means that the `init_logging` function is being called multiple times, or another part of the code is setting a global subscriber. To fix this, we should ensure that `init_logging` is only called once, typically at the start of the application.

Let's modify `src/lib.rs` to ensure `init_logging` is only called once:

src/lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
fn make_cache(offline: bool) -> PathBuf {
    init_logging();
=======
fn make_cache(offline: bool) -> PathBuf {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

To ensure `init_logging` is called only once, you should call it in the `main` function of your application, which is typically in `src/main.rs`. If you need to make changes to `src/main.rs`, please add it to the chat.

> Tokens: 6.9k sent, 183 received. Cost: $0.02 message, $0.09 session.  
> src/main.rs  
> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

Let's modify `src/main.rs` to ensure that `init_logging` is called only once at the start of the application. We'll move the logging initialization to the `main` function.

Here are the changes:

src/main.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
use tracing_subscriber;
=======
use israel_weather_rs::init_logging;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/main.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    let format = tracing_subscriber::fmt::format().pretty();

    tracing_subscriber::fmt().event_format(format).init();
=======
    init_logging();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the logging is initialized only once at the start of the application, preventing the `SetGlobalDefaultError`. After applying these changes, you can run your application again to verify that the issue is resolved.
